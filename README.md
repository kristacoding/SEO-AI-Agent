# SEO-AI-Agent
AI‑Powered SEO Technical Workflow by Krista Meiers
Overview
I designed and deployed an AI‑assisted SEO technical workflow that transforms raw crawl data into high‑quality, review‑ready SEO recommendations. The goal was not to simply generate content with AI, but to embed AI into an operational process with guardrails, validation, and human oversight.
________________________________________
The Problem
Large websites generate hundreds or thousands of SEO issues during audits—especially around title tags and meta descriptions (missing, too long, too short, or inconsistent).
Traditional approaches are time‑intensive, manual, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

The Solution
🔗 Live Demo: https://seo-ai-agent-py.streamlit.app/  (Screaming Frog Excel and OpenAI Key Required) 
I built an interactive AI SEO Agent that integrates crawl data, SEO best practices, and LLMs into a repeatable process.
Process: 
•	Ingests Screaming Frog crawl data and flags specific SEO issues 
•	Uses OpenAI GPT‑4–class models to generate optimized titles and meta descriptions 
•	Enforces hard SEO constraints 
•	Requires human approval before export

Technology & Architecture
•	LLMs: OpenAI GPT‑4–class models (with gpt‑4o‑mini used during development/testing)
•	Backend logic: Python (pandas, validation, parsing)
•	Interface: Streamlit (interactive review, approval, export)
•	Deployment: Publicly deployed via Streamlit Community Cloud

Impact & Value
This project reflects how I approach AI in professional environments: process‑first thinking, guardrails over guesswork, and scalable systems with human judgment built in. I’m excited to bring this mindset to teams looking to integrate AI into real workflows, whether in SEO, digital operations, or broader content and optimization processes.
•	Reduces manual SEO effort while improving consistency
•	Produces review-ready outputs aligned with SEO best practices
•	Scales across sites, audits, and teams
•	Demonstrates how AI can be operationalized—not just experimented with
